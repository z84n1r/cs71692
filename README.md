COMP 3141: Object Oriented Design and Programming
Project (10%)
Problem:
You need to develop a program code to build a   calculator.   The   program   should   open   with two options   of:
a.         Basic calculator
b.       Scientific   calculator
Basic calculator—This will allow the six basic functions of:
a.         Addition
b.       Subtraction
c.         Multiplication   d.      Division
e.         Square root   f.          Square
Scientific calculator—This will allow mathematical operations for sine,   cosine, etc.   (You may lead to the level of   operations.)
The project is done in   two   phases:
Phase   1
Plan all the classes with constructor, destructor, accessor,   and   mutators. You   will   need to do the class declaration in a header(.h)   file,   and   the   class   implementation   in   the   .cpp file.
Now add more methods in the classes for display   and   other   calculations.
Phase   2:
Design the driver program to display a menu to   take   user   input   for   the   type   of   calculator the user wishes to use. The calculator should keep on working until   the user wishes to quit. Also, there should be a chance   given   to   the   user   to   swi代 写COMP 3141: Object Oriented Design and ProgrammingC/C++
代做程序编程语言tch   to   the   alternative mode without closing and re-running the entire program.
Deliverables:
1.       PDF file having Phase 1 with   the   code   plan   explaining   the   OOPS   features you   have planned to use (40   marks)
2.       Phase 2 completed with screen   shots in   a   zipped   format   with   fully   executable   code   (50 marks)
10 marks are reserved for any additional features   you   add   in   the   project.   Do highlight them in the submission (e.g. using +/- keystrokes to   input   rather   than menu   choices, visual   display   for   menu, etc.).
